# Article's Abstract:

Valorization is one of the most heated discussions in the business community, and commoditiesvalorization is one subset in this task. Features of a product is an essential characteristic in valorizationand features are categorized into two classes:  graphical and non-graphical.  Nowadays, the valueof products is measured by price. The goal of this research is to achieve an arrangement to predictthe price of a product based on specifications of that.  We propose five deep learning models topredict the price range of a product, one unimodal and four multimodal systems. The multimodalmethods predict based on the image and non-graphical specification of product.  As a platform toevaluate the methods, a cellphones dataset has been gathered from GSMArena. In proposed methods,convolutional neural network is an infrastructure. The experimental results show 88.3% F1-score inthe best method.
